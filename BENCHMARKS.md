## Dense reconstruction of a sparse matrix

`CSparseMatrix::to_dense`, through the `SparseMatrix.to_numpy` binding, on a
sparse matrix built with the overlap screener at a threshold of 1.0e-14, then
allocated and zeroed. Timings are the best of the stated number of runs.

| crambin | def2-tzvp | 12063 | 1.08 | 0.10 | 0.017 | 63.5 | 3 |
| crambin | def2-qzvp | 28167 | 5.91 | 0.41 | 0.258 | 22.9 | 1 |
| ubiquitin | def2-svp | 11577 | 1.00 | 0.05 | 0.010 | 103.4 | 3 |
| ubiquitin | def2-tzvp | 22442 | 3.75 | 0.20 | 0.047 | 79.3 | 3 |

The cost tracks the size of the dense matrix, not the sparsity: the sparse
values are 0.05 to 0.87 GB against 1 to 21 GB of output. The rates of 60 to 100
GB/s in the middle of the range are consistent with writing the dense array at
memory bandwidth. The fall to 9.6 GB/s at 21 GB is page faulting and memory
pressure on a 36 GB machine, not the traversal.

Two independent runs agreed to within a few percent everywhere except the two
largest cases, which run once and have no minimum to take.

An attempt to split the cost into the zero fill and the sparse scatter gave
inconsistent results, as the allocation and page fault behaviour of the numpy
allocator and of pybind11 differ too much to compare. No split is reported.

## Dense reconstruction against the CMatrix chain

The same job through `CMatrix.to_numpy`, which calls `full_matrix()` and copies
the result into a numpy array. Both sides start from a zeroed container, so only
the reconstruction is measured.

| molecule | basis | nao | dense GB | CMatrix s | SparseMatrix s | speedup | runs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| tagrisso | def2-svp | 683 | 0.004 | 0.0004 | 0.0004 | 1.0x | 5 |
| tagrisso | def2-tzvp | 1345 | 0.013 | 0.001 | 0.0005 | 2.1x | 5 |
| tagrisso | def2-qzvp | 3099 | 0.072 | 0.006 | 0.002 | 3.5x | 5 |
| taxol | def2-svp | 1099 | 0.009 | 0.001 | 0.0003 | 2.6x | 5 |
| taxol | def2-tzvp | 2185 | 0.036 | 0.003 | 0.001 | 3.0x | 5 |
| taxol | def2-qzvp | 4947 | 0.182 | 0.015 | 0.004 | 3.5x | 5 |
| crambin | def2-svp | 6177 | 0.28 | 0.024 | 0.004 | 6.3x | 5 |
| crambin | def2-tzvp | 12063 | 1.08 | 0.103 | 0.017 | 6.2x | 3 |
| crambin | def2-qzvp | 28167 | 5.91 | 1.094 | 0.269 | 4.1x | 1 |
| ubiquitin | def2-svp | 11577 | 1.00 | 0.100 | 0.010 | 10.3x | 3 |
| ubiquitin | def2-tzvp | 22442 | 3.75 | 0.425 | 0.047 | 9.0x | 3 |
| ubiquitin | def2-qzvp | 53197 | 21.08 | out of memory | 2.780 | | 1 |

The advantage grows with the size of the molecule and shrinks with the richness
of the basis, as high angular momentum fills the matrix in and leaves less
sparsity to skip. Below a few thousand basis functions the two are
indistinguishable.

Peak resident set size, each path in its own process:

| molecule | basis | dense GB | SparseMatrix GB | CMatrix GB |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| crambin | def2-tzvp | 1.08 | 1.39 | 3.05 |
| ubiquitin | def2-tzvp | 3.75 | 4.18 | 10.07 |
| crambin | def2-qzvp | 5.91 | 6.53 | 15.65 |

The memory is the more consequential difference. The CMatrix chain holds the
blocked matrix, the full submatrix and the numpy copy at once, which measures
2.2 to 2.7 times the dense matrix. The sparse path holds the dense array and the
sparse values, which measures 1.10 to 1.29 times. This is why ubiquitin in
def2-qzvp reconstructs in 2.8 s through the sparse path and does not run at all
through the CMatrix chain on this machine, where it would need about 53 GB.

The default limit of `SparseMatrix.to_numpy` is 8 GB, so crambin in def2-qzvp
passes by default and ubiquitin in def2-qzvp requires an explicit `max_memory`.

## What the timings do not cover

The SIMD overlap kernel implements `(s|s)` only, so the sparse matrices timed
above are built with the real screening structure of the basis, allocated and
zeroed, rather than computed. The traversal visits every block, combination of
basis functions, angular component and atom pair exactly as it would for a
computed matrix, and both sides of the comparison are handicapped equally, but
the values are zeros.

The reconstruction was verified against the CMatrix chain to 1.1e-16 on systems
of s functions only, which is as far as the kernel currently reaches. The
angular component and stride handling of the dense mapping runs structurally in
the def2-qzvp cases above, up to g functions, but has never been checked against
reference values for non-zero angular momentum.
